MVVM architectur:
MVVM stands for Model View View-Model.
 MVVM is an architectural pattern that separates the graphical UI from the logic of the app.

# ViewModel
An object that syncs the Model and the View. In Vue.js, every Vue instance is a ViewModel. 
They are instantiated with the Vue constructor or its sub-classes

# View
The actual DOM that is managed by Vue instances.
Vue.js uses DOM-based templating. Each Vue instance is associated with a corresponding DOM element.
Responsible for displaying data.

#View Model
In Vue.js, models are simply plain JavaScript objects, or data objects.
 Once an object is used as data inside a Vue instance, it becomes reactive. You can manipulate 
their properties and Vue instances that are observing them will be notified of the changes.
